# Problem : Decode a message 
---

A message has been encoded as a text stream that is to be read character by character. The stream contains a series of comma-delimited integers, each a positive number capable of being represented by a C++ int. However, the character represented by a particular integer depends on the current decoding mode. There are three modes : uppercase, lowercase, and punctuation.
