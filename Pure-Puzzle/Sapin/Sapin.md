# Goal
--- 

The principle of this algorithm is to take control of commands in C++. 

The user chooses the height of his tree and the algorithm returns a tree whose length of each floor increases by two each time.

# Improvement 
---

We would try to add a trunk to this tree which would only be aesthetic but not make the exercise more difficult.
